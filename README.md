# The Hug Network

I read about the many versions of license, and I only have one thing In mind, TRANSPARENCY. 
That means the code is supposed to be Open-Source, but not supposed to be shared and duplicated.
The more people that work on one project, the better it will become, and innovation evolves the 
project. I don't like the idea of 100 or million different versions of the same thing, just because
one person didn't like one change over the other. 

I want "The Hug Network" to be Transparent in how it works, in order to fix potential problems fast.
Not that it's to be copied in order to be made for profit or other things. 

The Hug Network is a POD network, that bases it's usage upon the connection between POD's, but still
has a search feature from a central server in order to connect everyone transparently. 

It is supposed to be a different way to connect to each other, by having a pod, all information about
you is in that pod, medical records, crimes commited, age, name, school grades, and a lot of more
governmental history all in one place, and you get 'partially' full reign upon what to share and to 
whom to share it. 

I want this project to be open-source, but a project that people work upon, not that people copy. 

I'm trasparent with my vision because I know how it's supposed to look like. Every POD has it's own 
stream of information, and this is a way in order to change the course of history. Right now servers
are hosting sites that might not be visited while 1/10:th of everything else is in use. 

The internet was created for the purpose of sharing information, but later on it became something
for the corporations to influence and control. Free speech shouldn't be censor the individual, it should
be free, and secure, and that is why it came to me to visualize this project openly. I am not enough,
I will not have the capability to use existing digital technology in order to connect people, that's
why I need others. 

The Hug Network is a three part project, POD, Browser & Network, in a way. The POD holds every personal
information about you, and you chose to share what you want to share, to whom and what agency or corporation.
The browser will only work when the POD is connected. What is the first page you see when you open the 
WWW browser? Often enough a blank page with the most visited pages or some reports of recent events. 

How would you feel about that first page being your own? The expression of you, and the one where
you share everything from? Short posts, Long posts, Blogs, pictures, files, and information. A whole new
browser interface, that uses the innovations of our time, like peer2peer in order to secure backups, or 
why not just choosing a file from the computer and a torrent will be created directly, dragging a picture
to the personal representation and expression and you will be able to add it with a post, and it will be
your newest post. One login, with a hardware key to the pod. 

How about no more visit to 10 different streaming sites? How about only having one player acting as a 
streaming service? You visit a site like @youtube, and subscribe to a channel and it get's added to your 
streaming service, maybe you just hate having Disney, YouTube, HBO and Netflix etc. on different sites
why not just having all of them being added with an API and you paying for what you watch instead of 
a monthly fee?

What about problems on the internet? Oh you mean crimes commited and not being taken seriously? How about
being able to just report it to the police directly? Or an accident? Report it as it happens?

Age restrictions? 13+ for incremental freedom. 0-12 through the parents POD's making it virtually impossible
for children to do what their parents don't allow them. 0-12, 13-15, 16-18, 19-21 and 21+ where in the age 
ranges can only speak to people within their own age range, but also serving different purposes with 
direct democratic features, wherein 16+ gains acces to vote in different matters incrementally. School, work,
communication, politics and connections. 

Every new Pod created is an actual person, because they are manually created and verified, so no more bots, 
no more false identities etc. Internet should be free, and it will be as long as you and those around you
don't brake the laws, but since direct democracy is in it's core The Hug Network works to release people
from every kind of ill situation. 

Why now use block-chain technology why we are at it? How about all information shared and ads created goes
through the application? How about every person gets an EQUAL share of everything? Ads shown? Well you have 
to pay through The Hug Network, the project will take what is needed to hold the servers up, and every programmer
that gives time to the project will get payed for what they contribute, and the spoils that expand past costs
of administration, service and workers, is going to be payed to EVERY registered pod. 

It's so much more then this. I can go on and on, forever, but I need help. A lot of help actually. 

The POD holds the information is the unlock for connectivity into the network, the network is peer-to-peer based 
with end-to-end encryption, and the server site is the connection wherein you search TRANSPARENTLY between
people, corporations or organisations. Oh? You have a brand? Well start the brand from your pod, and create
another page to represent yourself. The search as I envision it is just a database of links, and every link 
when you hover it will show a small 'business card' which display your chosen shared information, such as nick 
or real name or brand, or organisation or anything else that you feel having as public information.

You visit an 'expression' on the Hug Network, and it will instantly like every worker and their line of work
so no more pyramid schemes or other scam companies, because if it's caught, damn! The police will be the next
thing they are reported to. 

Communication? Oh, that's through the browser entierly, no more need to use 15 different apps or websites in order
to write people, video, audio, text, pictures, etc. 

You are unemployed? That's too sad, why don't have it work for you? So someone needs a worker, and you can be
contacted directly if needed and you can state your line of work, and if you are open for suggestions. 

The browser has a wallet address connected to the POD, which deals with The Hug Network monopoly currency, that 
works across the whole network/platform. If people want to use it as a real currency (Which it's thought out to be)
then the wallet is supposed to be complex enough to handle logs of payments and transfers, and I have even 
thought about a second currency, that is supposed to be in use for votes. No more taxes, but instead it's going
to use a donation system. You subscribe to an RSS feed, and because of people being able ta tag their posts, 
to different subjects, everything in that feed will be based in a filtration system of latest to last, last to latest,
hour, 24hour, week, month, quarter, year, genre, or whatever. Every post that people make will require 
a definition, and that definitian will be used for searches, definitions will be able to be voted upon, and if 
a specific amount of votes outweigh the opposition within a time-frame, then the definition will change to the 
purposed alternative. 

As I wrote, it's much bigger then this. This is nothing towards what it can become, if people help me.
